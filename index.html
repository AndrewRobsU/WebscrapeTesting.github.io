<h2> a sip of morning dew </h2>
<p> i woke up to the golden hue of dawn       
shining through the window        and so i
with weary eyes	stagger across the gray
room           tracing along the walls to make out
the folds in the curtains	lazily drawn
to unveil millions of droplets	       each proof
that Heaven still sheds tears of gold for Earth </p>
<p> clutters of letters are stacked on the desk
in a disarray akin to the socks
shirts and shoes sprawled across the stone-cold slabs
i pull out a chair from beneath the desk 
and sit        afraid that even the slightest 
of sounds may break this ice that mends my lost soul </p>
<p> when was the last time we went gardening
in the yard         raising life up from the ground
and feast on cabbages and squash and beets
boiled in a pot         foaming at the surface </p>
<p> and that one time    when we had gone hiking
over lush green valleys and achromic
rivers      you told me which plants you could eat
and which ones would bite back       i remember
that day when you gave me some sour grass
i would clasp my hands for another which
you would pluck and give me       as adeptly
as a spider weaving her silky home </p>
<p> now i look out that window       and i think
about its unrefined beauty        a sight
so complicated that i would never
understand        even if i read thousands
of books of dedicated my entire
life to knowing you         i would still never
know why you decided to bet on me
when you could have bet on anyone else </p>
<p> I want to apologize for running
from home; for never looking at you when
all you ever did was look at me and
smile, as if you saw something in a kid
who took everything for granted because
he didn’t know better. I hope that I’ll
see you sometime soon, so that I can show
you how much I’ve grown, so that you can take
pride in what I’ve become, pray that that day
will come soon. </p>
<h2> All-Nighters </h2>
<p> As dusk turns to dawn, you sit there, eyes dry from the nights I have spent studying 
instead of sleeping. In a stoic manner, you endure your wretched routine and convince your 
deteriorating mind to put up with intense studying for just one more night. However, this is not 
your first night this week spent cramming for tests. Odysseus was the mastermind behind the 
Trojan War. King Mycenae led a coalition of Greek forces at Troy. As you close your laptop and 
stand up, you scavenge around the dark room for the door. Your mind suddenly goes blank, and 
you overstep at the stairs. </p>
<div id="stairs">
<div id="image"><img src="./dark_stairs2.jpg" width=150px></div>
<p>It isn’t long before you feel air pushing against your chest, and papers 
flying all around your head. You reach out to grab one, only to have it dance farther from your 
hand. And as you try to take a step, you realize you can’t. There is no ground beneath you. 
Suddenly, your head starts feeling heavy, and your eyes begin to burn. You close them and 
suddenly, you feel your arms go limp. You can’t stop yourself from taking this head on. All of a 
sudden, your legs buckle together. You are emptied after a hit in the chest, and all you can see is 
a light hue. Then, blackness and your mind grasped for information. Where am I? How badly am 
I hurt? Should I move? There was a wooden horse? It has been a week since you last got any 
proper sleep. Just stop worrying. List your priorities. Try to sleep. </p>
<h2> Cancun Trip </h2>
<p> When we went back out onto the beach, the sun had already reached the horizon. I caper 
from under a palette of red and pink, weaving and bobbing around vacant shoals, sprinting 
forwards with a haste and naïveté fitting of a ten year old. I had caught wind of the fact that we 
were going to see baby turtles, and I was growing more and more restless by the second, waiting 
for the event where I could hold one up; I would bear witness to a spectacle, or so I believed. 
When we arrived, the sun had become the inside of a custard bun, gushing out and into the sky, 
painting the way to the horizon. I scavenge the shore in search of baby turtles, hopeful to catch 
one during this fleeting moment. After a quick scout, I spot a lady beckoning three of them 
along. The lady was warm, I could see it in her smile, but she was distant, bound only to the light 
shining at the end of the sea. I greet the woman with a smile and three words: “what are these?” 
She didn’t look at me, instead revealing that they are pacific sea turtles, “babies just like you;” I 
felt as if I were talking to the horizon, something far too far for me to see or comprehend. I made 
no effort to converse after that, only smiling now and then while I waited for my family to arrive. </p>
<p> The baby sea turtles depart one at a time, crawling down to the seashore, leaving nothing 
more than the heavy imprints of their flippers, accompanied by the thin marks of a tail trail to the 
shore. Even the runt, with its uncanny white flippers, was clawing at the ground like a dead man, 
like it was the last day of the world. Its endurance was incredible, and amidst my admiration I 
asked my sister, the wisest in the family, why its skin seemed so chalky. “It’s albino,” she said, 
with a solemn smile, “it’s a trait which one may be born with.” “So does that make it special?” I 
ignorantly listen as my sister delivers a synopsis about it, catching the last few words, that “it is 
special, but in a different way from us.” “How so?” “It was born with a feature that makes living 
harder for it.” I wasn’t a fool; I knew she was saying that “it would die,” because behind her 
smile, I detected distance, and so I pry ever so slightly more: “what happens after you die?” “I 
don’t know,” she says. </p>
<p> Everything feels bigger on the way back. The beach is now infinitely wide, with the 
ocean beside it so vast it feels oppressing. I try kicking sand, once, twice, and before the third 
time I become far too fatigued to even move a muscle. My head is heavy and my fingers are 
numb as I imagine the unimaginable: what is death like? But all I can see is darkness; the 
beginning of a void that death could never fill; one that forever only belonged to life. And so I 
vow that, until that life is taken away, I will live like those baby turtles and crawl on as if all will 
end tomorrow, as everything ends the second you stop moving and let death catch up. I look back 
at the horizon, only to be met with aloofness; the air had become ever so slightly cooler. </p>
